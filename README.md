### â–¶ How to play
- Once the movie is being shown, you have **20 seconds** to write the right answer. 
- An **autossugest** field will help you.
- Your **score** is based on the time left, so the fast you are, the points you earn.
- At half time, you will get a new picture of the same movie.
- You have **3 lifes** to accumulate points.
- TIP 1: just use your keyboard. Auto-focus will help you to be faster.

### ðŸ§± How it works
- Thanks to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), I generate a set of movies and save them in a database. This is our **Set to Play**.
- The **Set** is basically a group of movies from 1980 sorted by vote average. This will update every week automatically.
- From that **Set**, the app is showing two backdrops from a random movie.
